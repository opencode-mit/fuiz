# Installation

To install the necassary dependancies run the following command in the root directory of the project:

<pre><code style="word-break: break-all">npm install</code></pre>

Then to compile and start the server:

<pre><code style="word-break: break-all">npm run start-server</code></pre>

This will start the server and listen to requests on the default port **8888**, which can be changed in `src/config.ts`.
